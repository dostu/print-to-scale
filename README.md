- Specify the real-world dimensions (in millimeters) of the selected area
- Automatically scale the image to print at 1:1 scale
- Ultra-high-resolution processing (1200 DPI) for superior print quality

1. **Open the application**

   - Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser

2. **Upload an image**

   - Click the "Upload Image" button and select an image from your computer
